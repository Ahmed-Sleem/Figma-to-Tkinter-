# Figma-to-Tkinter-
can we design TKinter GUI with drap and drop designer instead of coding ???
can TK really make a modern UI with ease??
yeah! just follow the instructions to be able to design your GUIs in Figma then convert it to python TKinter with one click !


# how to use :
- simply install the requirment then run the gui.py file to open the converter 
- enter your figma account token id and the figma file url then choose the path for the output and click generate !
- the program will generate the python gui file and save it in the choosen path 
- do not forget to use the naming code in your figma file to make it possible for the converter to identify your elements 
- the naming code is writen in the converter gui
